## About me 

I am currently a senior undergraduate at the University of Colorado Boulder studying physics and statistics. I particulary enjoy coding for data analysis and machine learning topics. During my free time I enjoy playing chess and the guitar. On the bottom is a list of my projects I've done over the last few years.  

## Projects 

### Solar System Simular Project 

This project was about modeling the solar system and asterioids in python to analyze asteroid-earth collision probablities within a 10 year time frame. Another part of the project was to create a function for the projection of Halley's Comet using the equtions of motion. I added test functions for these projections to confirm the physics worked out, and on the legend HC(O) stands for the orbit and HC(T) stands for what the trajectory function did.

### Linear Regression Analysis 

The Linear Regression Analysis is a project I worked on in my machine learning course, where I compared the different levels of complexity for each model. Another part of the project was to look the bias variance trade off for the model, and a good way to show this theory is to compare a group of 100 samples from each level of complexity which is shown on the second plot using the Colin Mallows statistic.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/VincentPeng-Web/VincentPeng-Web.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
