## About me 

I am currently a senior undergraduate at the University of Colorado Boulder studying physics and statistics. I particulary enjoy coding for data analysis and machine learning topics. During my free time I enjoy playing chess and the guitar. On the bottom is a list of my projects I've done over the last few years.  

## Projects 

### Solar System Simular Project 

This project was about modeling the solar system and asterioids in python to analyze asteroid-earth collision probablities within a 10 year time frame. Another part of the project was to create a function for the projection of Halley's Comet using the equtions of motion. I added test functions for these projections to confirm the physics worked out.
