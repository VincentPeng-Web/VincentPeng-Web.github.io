## About me 

I am currently a senior undergraduate at the University of Colorado Boulder studying physics and statistics. I particulary enjoy coding for data analysis and machine learning topics. During my free time I enjoy playing chess and the guitar. On the bottom is a list of my projects I've done over the last few years.  

## Projects 

### Solar System Simular Project 

This project was about modeling the solar system and asterioids in python to analyze asteroid-earth collision probablities within a 10 year time frame. Another part of the project was to create a function for the projection of Halley's Comet using the equtions of motion. I added test functions for these projections to confirm the physics worked out, and on the legend HC(O) stands for the orbit and HC(T) stands for what the trajectory function did.

### Regression Analysis 

The Regression Analysis is a project I worked on in my machine learning course, where I wanted to compare models with different levels of complexities with a true model using randomly generated noisy data . The first graph shows the true model(black curve) and the generated noisy points in green. The rest of the plot shows the different levels of complexities using regression analysis.  Another part of the project was to look the bias variance trade off for the model, and a good way to show this theory is to compare a group of 100 samples from each level of complexity which is shown on the second plot using the Colin Mallows statistic.

### LDA, QDA, and Baye's Classifier Project 

One of the main topics in machine learning is classification, so this project was about comparing Linear Discriminant Analysi(LDA), Quadratic discriminant analysis(QDA), and the optimal Baye's Classifier. The first plot shows three samples of multivariate guassian distributions, the LDA boundary(magenta), and the Baye's classifier boundary(black). The second part of the project was to predict the diagnosis of Cushing Syndrome using concentrations of steroid metabolites and tetrahydrocortisone and pregnanetriol. This project's focus was on three different forms of the syndrome which are adenoma(green), bilateral hyperplasia(blue), and carcinoma(red). The plot shows each form in their labeled color and the QDA in black.
